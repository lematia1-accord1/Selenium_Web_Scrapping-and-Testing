This project contains a collection of web scraping and browser automation testing scripts built using Selenium WebDriver in Python. It automates web interactions for extracting data from websites and for testing web application behavior.

The scripts are designed to:

- Scrape data from various websites by navigating, searching, and extracting information automatically.

- Perform automated browser testing to simulate user interactions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and verifying UI elements.

- Support running in a controlled virtual environment (venv) to keep dependencies isolated and easy to manage.

Features:
- Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) via Selenium WebDriver.

- Automated data collection and export for use in data analysis or business intelligence.

- Scripts structured for ease of customization and extension.

- Error handling and dynamic waits for reliable scraping and testing.

- Integration with ChromeOptions and Remote WebDriver for flexible deployment.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

- Google Chrome or Firefox browser installed (for Selenium drivers).

- chromedriver or appropriate WebDriver installed and accessible in your system PATH.

- Internet connection to access target websites and GitHub.

Getting Started:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/lematia1-accord1/Selenium_Web_Scrapping-and-Testing.git
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate       # On Linux/macOS
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run your chosen scraping or testing script:

python your_script.py
Usage:
- Modify scripts to target specific URLs or interact with different web elements.

- Customize wait times, selectors, and output formats as needed.

- Use ChromeOptions for headless operation or other browser customizations.

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure WebDriver version matches your browser version.

- Check internet connectivity if scraping fails to resolve hosts.

- Review logs and exceptions for Selenium-specific errors.

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the scripts or add new features.
